    title: 'Startup A Bit: How big of a human problem are you solving? by <strong>Sword Health</strong>'
    speaker: Virgílio Bento
    speakerBio: "Virgílio Bento was born in Guarda, Portugal, in 1984. <br> Having realized from an early age that there was much to do and so little being done in the field of rehabilitation, he knew he should step in to change that. <br> He was aware that the key for a democratic and efficient global health was in the development of technologies that overcome socioeconomic barriers and explore how humans have the potential to self-rehabilitate. <br> That was why, during his PhD in Electronics Engineering, Virgílio developed SWORD, a disruptive tool in motor rehabilitation that empowers patients, extending the therapeutic footprint to their homes. <br> Following his PhD work, he founded Sword Health, where he’s leading the design and development of innovative digital health systems, targeted at the medical market of cognitive and motor rehabilitation. <br> Always seeking to solve problems through technology, Virgílio also co-developed an innovative tracking system for children and pets, without monthly fees. In 2014, the idea was funded with more than $100k on Indiegogo, leading to the inception of Findster of which he is one of the founders. <br> Findster broke several geographic barriers being one of the first Portuguese technologies to be featured on TechCrunch and backed by 700 contributors from more than 45 countries. <br> Besides owning 3 patents at the age of 30, Virgílio has already authored and co-authored more than 40 research papers. Having his footprint in diverse fields such as sensor fusion algorithms, motion quantification systems, neuroplasticity or stroke rehabilitation, he was featured in some of the most relevant scientific publications and took part in the most important MedTech conferences. <br> He’s also a Professor at University Institute of Maia, Portugal, where he teaches Innovation and Entrepreneurship. <br> Daring in design, cautious in execution, Virgílio's path is being shaped by his will to make a dent in the universe, having technology as his major ally."

    abstract: 'We see technology changing our lives everyday, from something so simple as a social network to self-driving cars and deep learning. The problem with the current trend in the technological world is that we are not applying our talent towards hard problems that have a real and significant impact in humanity. At SWORD Health, we believe in empowering our best engineers towards the solution of big problems. We started by reinventing how physical rehabilitation is performed globally. And we’re just starting.'
    organizationBio: 'At SWORD Health, we created the first digital therapy in the physical rehabilitation industry that automates the 1-to-1 patient-therapist interaction, plummeting healthcare costs, empowering patients and ensuring accountability. SWORD is considered by the European Commission as one of the most innovative companies in Europe.'
